# Solar Panel Efficiency Prediction

This project focuses on predicting solar panel efficiency using machine learning models. The primary models used are **RandomForestRegressor** and **XGBoostRegressor**. The project involves hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models and a comparison to select the best-performing one.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- numpy
- pandas

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
